<h1>MadLib</h1>
<h2>Okay, let's see what you've got:</h2>
<div>
    <p>One day a moose named <?php echo $_POST["name"]; ?> [name] did something terrible: [secret].
        They didn't care who they hurt. and they did it all just for some [dessert].
        Then they put on their [check] and rode off into the sunset.
        Well, a bunny saw this and couldn't stand for the madness.</p>

    <p>The bunny followed the moose and confronted them - meet me here on [date] and we shall duel!
        the moose said, bunny, you and I are both herbivores;
        we're not suited for battle. the bunny replied, what you did killed
        [number] of my family members. we shall duel for their honor,
        and I shall paint the earth [color] with your blood.
        The moose was confused, but an honorable moose nonetheless. They agreed to show. </p>

    <p>So when that day came, the moose prepared for a terrible fight.
        they visited [website] for some tips, but had no luck.
        the moose said, all I ever wanted was [life], how did I end up here?
        Strangely though, a note on the door caught their eye on the way out.
        it only had [phone] written on it.
    </p>

    <p>They called the number who was it but the bunny!
        they said, I can't meet today (little did the moose know, the bunny had a forgotten dentist visit)
        but the first of [month] I shall vanquish you moose, and with that avenge my family.
        the moose tried to talk them out of it once more, but sadly without any success.
        they hung up and each marked their calendars.
    </p>

    <p>Once again, that day came and the moose prepared for a gruesome fight.
        the moose offered the bunny an [email] but they had no clue what do to do with it.
        the bunny said, if you want we can reschedule for [week], my fav restaurant is open early today.
        the moose said, No, no more rescheduling, I can't take this anymore!
        I'm sorry I hurt your family. I don't know what I can offer you.
        the bunny said, well, I haven't laughed since that day.
        If you can can give me a real belly laugh, maybe I can start letting go.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moose was [sandcastles] sure they could do it. They gave it a try.
        The moose said, [joke].
        The bunny took a moment, then exploded with laughter.
        they laughed and laughed and laughed till they could laugh no more.
        they said, I've never haven't heard such a terrible joke.
        In all honesty, I haven't laughed that way since I was a wee kit.
        Thank you moose. I haven't forgiven you yet for murdering my family without a care in the world,
        but I am starting to realize there is more to life than just vengeance.

    <p>Little did the bunny know, the moose had taken the opportunity to
        escape as quickly as possible. they had decided that day to go start a new life in alaska.
        when the bunny turned around and noticed, they cursed and shook their little bunny fist in the air.
        but they could not deny what the moose had given them,
        so decided to call it a day and hopped back into the woods...
