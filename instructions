####################### Traversing #######################

Exercises

    Open the file named jquery_faq.html for editing. Commit all changes to GitHub.

    - Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above.
    - Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.

    - Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.

    - When any h3 is clicked, the lis underneath it should be bolded. Use font-weight: bold to achieve this.

    - When any list item is clicked, first li of the parent ul should have a font color of blue.

Bonus

- Create 3 divs that each look like a picture Frame;
    each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame.
    Use Traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this.

    The rules are the following:
        The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.
        The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.
        The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.




####################### Effects #######################

Exercises

For this exercise, we will continue working on the jquery_faq.html file.

    At the top of the page, add a div with two elements, an h1 that reads "Would you like to sign up for our newsletter?" and a span that has an 'x' in it. When the 'x' is clicked, hide the entire div element.

    The uls next to each h3 that contain facts about each park should start out hidden, and when the corresponding h3 is clicked, the display of the ul should be toggled with a sliding effect.

    After the user has been on the page for 8 seconds, an h2 should fade in that asks the user to register for the site.

    As always, make sure you are adding, commiting and pushing to Github.

Bonus

    Use a bootstrap alert for the dismissable message that shows on page load.

    Use a bootstrap modal for the message that fades in after 8 seconds. You may find that you can use bootstrap's modal methods to achieve the fading effect.


################## Ajax - Weather Map Project ##################


Update your layout and ajax request(s) to display a three day forecast for San Antonio that looks like the screenshot below.

3 Day Forecast

The URLs for OpenWeatherMap's icons are formatted http://openweathermap.org/img/w/[icon].png where [icon] comes from the API request.

    Create input boxes for "Latitude" and "Longitude" and a <button> that will take the values from those inputs and feed them into your API request. Use Google Maps to find the coordinates for different places around the world and test this out.

    Go back to your Google Maps API exercise. Recreate the map below your 3 day forecast. Read through the documentation for the Google Maps API and figure out how to allow the user to drop a pin on any place on the map. Once the user drops a pin, grab its coordinates and feed those into your OpenWeatherMap API. Update the three day forecast with the information from those coordinates (you should also get rid of your input boxes at this point).

    As you complete each step, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
