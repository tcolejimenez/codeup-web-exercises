To build this game, follow these steps:

Bonus

    - Add a start button. Don't start the game until the button is pressed.

    - Add a timer. Only allow clicks during the period.
        If the timer is 30 seconds, the game should quit recording clicks after 30 seconds,
        and should activate the start button. Clicking the start button should reset the game.
